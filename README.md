# abtop

**Like [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop), but for your AI coding agents.**

See every Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode session at a glance — token usage, context window %, rate limits, child processes, open ports, and more.
Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode sessions are discovered from local process/file state, so multiple active profiles are supported across macOS, Linux, and Windows.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graykode/abtop/main/assets/demo.gif)

## Why

- Running 3+ agents across projects? See them all in one screen.
- Hitting rate limits? Watch your quota in real-time.
- Agent spawned a server and forgot to kill it? Orphan port detection.
- Context window filling up? Per-session % bars with warnings.

All read-only. No API keys. No auth.

## Install

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases/latest/download/abtop-installer.sh | sh
```

### Cargo

```bash
cargo install abtop
```

### Windows

Native support — no WSL required. Uses `sysinfo` for process info and `netstat -ano` for listening ports.

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases/latest/download/abtop-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

Or `cargo install abtop` from any terminal with Git in PATH. Claude Code config is resolved automatically from `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`.

### Other

Pre-built binaries for all platforms are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases) page.

## Usage

```bash
abtop                    # Launch TUI
abtop --once             # Print snapshot and exit
abtop --json             # Print one JSON snapshot and exit (for scripts/tools)
abtop --setup            # Install rate limit collection hook
abtop --theme dracula    # Launch once with a specific theme (does not edit config)
```

Recommended terminal size: **120x40** or larger. Minimum 80x24 — panels hide gracefully when small.

### tmux

abtop works standalone, but running inside tmux unlocks session jumping — press `Enter` to switch directly to the pane running that agent.

```bash
tmux new -s work
# pane 0: abtop
# pane 1: claude (project A)
# pane 2: claude (project B)
# → Enter on a session in abtop jumps to its pane
```

OpenCode support reads the local SQLite database at `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` and requires `sqlite3` in `PATH`.

## Themes

12 built-in themes, including 4 colorblind-friendly options (`high-contrast`, `protanopia`, `deuteranopia`, `tritanopia`). Press `t` to cycle built-in and configured custom themes at runtime; cycling writes the selected theme to your config file. `--theme <name>` is a one-run launch override and does not edit the config by itself.

## Configuration

abtop reads one config file from the platform config directory. There is no `--config` flag, and abtop does not read `./config.toml` from the current directory.

| Platform | Config path |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Linux / XDG | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/abtop/config.toml`, or `~/.config/abtop/config.toml` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/abtop/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\abtop\config.toml` |

The config file supports:

```toml
theme = "btop"
# Hide specific agent CLIs from the TUI (case-insensitive).
# Useful if you only use one agent and want a cleaner view.
hidden_agents = ["codex"]
# Additional Claude Code profile roots to scan.
# abtop also auto-discovers ~/.claude and ~/.claude-* roots that contain
# both sessions/ and projects/.
claude_config_dirs = ["~/.claude-personal", "~/.claude-work-team"]
# UI language. Omit or leave empty to auto-detect from LANG.
language = "zh"
```

### Custom themes

Define custom themes in the same config file with `[themes.<name>]`, then set `theme = "<name>"` or launch `abtop --theme <name>`. Custom theme names must match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,63}`; invalid custom theme sections are ignored fail-soft. Custom themes are appended to the `t` cycle after built-ins, and built-in names always win over same-named custom themes. Unknown `theme = "..."` values in config fall back to `btop`; unknown `--theme <name>` values exit with an error. Unknown custom `base` values fall back to `btop`. Malformed color/gradient values are ignored and inherit from the base theme; config values are parsed as data only, with no code execution.

Exact schema:

```toml
theme = "midnight"

[themes.midnight]
# Optional built-in base to inherit from. Defaults to "btop".
base = "dracula"

# Color fields accept quoted #RRGGBB values. Any omitted or malformed field
# inherits from base.
main_bg = "#101018"
main_fg = "#e6e6f0"
title = "#ffffff"
hi_fg = "#ff79c6"
selected_bg = "#303050"
selected_fg = "#ffffff"
inactive_fg = "#666680"
graph_text = "#8888aa"
meter_bg = "#24243a"
proc_misc = "#50fa7b"
div_line = "#303050"
session_id = "#f1fa8c"
status_fg = "#ff5555"
warning_fg = "#f1fa8c"
cpu_box = "#8be9fd"
mem_box = "#bd93f9"
net_box = "#ff79c6"
proc_box = "#ff5555"

# Gradient fields are arrays of three quoted #RRGGBB values:
# [low, mid, high].
cpu_grad = ["#50fa7b", "#f1fa8c", "#ff5555"]
proc_grad = ["#50fa7b", "#f1fa8c", "#ff5555"]
used_grad = ["#44475a", "#ff79c6", "#ff5555"]
free_grad = ["#282a36", "#50fa7b", "#8be9fd"]
cached_grad = ["#282a36", "#8be9fd", "#bd93f9"]
```

### Supported Languages

| Code | Language            |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| `en` | English (default)   |
| `zh` | Simplified Chinese  |

When `language` is unset, abtop auto-detects from `LANG` — any value starting with `zh` switches to Simplified Chinese, otherwise English.

## Library / JSON snapshot

abtop is also a library crate, so local tools can reuse its data-collection
layer in-process — no re-scanning, no subprocesses — and serialize the same
state the TUI renders.

```bash
abtop --json    # one-shot JSON snapshot for scripts
```

For long-running consumers, build an `App`, refresh it with
`App::tick_no_summaries()` (which never spawns `claude --print`, so it doesn't
touch your Claude quota), and call `App::to_snapshot(interval_ms)` to get a
JSON-serializable [`Snapshot`]:

```rust,no_run
use abtop::app::App;
use abtop::{config, theme::Theme};

let cfg = config::load_config();
let mut app = App::new_with_config_and_claude_dirs(
    Theme::default(), &cfg.hidden_agents, cfg.panels, &cfg.claude_config_dirs,
);
app.tick_no_summaries();
let json = serde_json::to_string(&app.to_snapshot(2_000)).unwrap();
```

`App` is not `Send` (it owns the collectors), so keep it on one thread and pass
the serialized JSON elsewhere. [abtop-web-ui](https://github.com/XKHoshizora/abtop-web-ui)
is a reference consumer: a local-first web dashboard built on exactly this API.

## Privacy

abtop reads local files and local process/open-file metadata only. No API keys, no auth. In the TUI and `--once` output, tool names and file paths are shown, but file contents and prompt text are never displayed. Session summaries are generated via `claude --print`, which makes its own API call — this is the only indirect network usage.

The JSON snapshot includes richer local dashboard data, including `summary`, `chat_messages`, working directories, config roots, tool-call previews, child process commands, token counts, and port metadata. Chat text is bounded and redacted by the collectors, but it is still derived from local transcripts and may contain sensitive project context. Treat JSON snapshots as local/private data and avoid writing them to shared logs or exposing them on a network without your own access controls.

## Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to [@tbouquet](https://github.com/tbouquet) for driving much of abtop's recent shape — themes, config overlay and panel toggles, session filtering, subagent tree view, the context window gauge with compaction detection, plus a steady stream of fixes and security hardening along the way.
